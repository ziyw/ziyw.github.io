Damn, life happens so fast. The past couple months have been packed with incredible experiences.  

- Switched the career path, a couple times. 

- Moved, a couple times. 

- Traveled alone to some cities I've never been before, a couple times. 

- Pushed myself to some edges and failed pretty bad, more than a couple times. 

Many of these things I have never done before, most of those things actually.  
But somehow I miraculously managed to survive all of these and now settle down with a new job and a new apartment in a new city.

The only reason that I can pull all of these off is the love and support from the people around me. 
So grateful to have them in my life, every single day. 

Now I can finally sit down, open vim, with a calm and peaceful mind, and start to write something. Feels like the last time I did this is a life time away.  
 
Life is short. Learn more, experience more, love more.  

Alrighty, let's continue this journey.
