title: A Week of Unity Shader  
---

Stumbled into a lot of problems as I'm trying to write some shaders this week.
Here are some resources I think it's useful for learning shaders. 

What is shader <https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Shaders.html>

A good tutorial of how to use Shaderlab <https://www.ronja-tutorials.com/2018/03/20/hlsl-basics.html>

Unity vertex and fragment shader example <https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SL-VertexFragmentShaderExamples.html>

Special setting for XR devices <https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SinglePassInstancing.html> 

The built-in variables and functions are used pretty often. Don't panic when see one unfamiliar name.

Still very new to shaders. Computer graphics is intriguing.
