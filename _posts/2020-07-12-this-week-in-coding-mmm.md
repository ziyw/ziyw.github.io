title: 'This Week in Coding: The Mythical Man-Month' 
---

This week's content is not directly about coding, but some thoughts around a coding related life. 

This weekend I read The Mythical Man-Month, written by Frederick Brook. It's a famous book about managing software projects, with its strong statement that there is no silver bullet for solving all the productivity problems in the software development process.

The book focuses more on increasing the productivity of teamwork. But I do find some ideas that can be generalized to an individual's day-to-day life. Here are something I found helpful. 

- **Making clear goals.** The book stresses the importance of making objectives clear a lot. It also points out it is hard to conduct because a lot of time people don't really know what they want. I fount it's very true for my life. Fuzzy goals lead to late actions. Fuzzy deadlines are no deadlines. The unclearness of goals only produces procrastination and infinite delay. Setting a goal takes time, but it will save you time later. 

- **Quantify productivity.** Brook gives diagrams and numbers to measure productivity. I used to have an illusion that productivity is a feeling: when I feel productive, I'm being productive. The truth is productivity is a solid number, the amount of work divides by time. 

- **Write things down.**  Because "only the written plan is precise and communicable." Aside from communication, I do feel writing things down improves my thought process. 

Alright, that's it. I don't want to go overgeneralizing it and turning  MMM into a self-helping book.As I am now more convinced about there is no silver bullet, I'm happy that we are in the process of creating some brass bullets.
