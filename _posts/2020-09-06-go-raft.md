title: 'This Week in Coding: Go with Raft (not yet)' 
---

Last week after reading raft, I thought it's a good idea to actually implement it.  
Then I thought this might be a good chance for me to learn go. 

So this week, as a starting point, I built a very simple p2p server in go.  

First thing first, go lang. This might be the third time I "learn" go. 
Previously I learned the syntax of it but I never use it often enough to get a good understanding of go. 
So this time, I still need to start form the very beginning. 

Second, build a server. Among all the options, I picked gRPC. 

As the starting point to write Raft in Go, I wrote [this](https://github.com/ziyw/go_p2p), a very simple go p2p example project.  
It is simple, only contains the skeleton of a gRPC server.  
I found it's helpful for me to have this simple project as a reference to some syntax or names 
that I can't totally memorize yet. 

And that's it for this week. Happy coding :)
