This post is about what I have done from October to December 2020.  

# What happened? 

After go-raft was finished, I realized my interest for distributed systems can't just be limited to reading papers and textbooks. 
I wanted to get my hands dirty with real-life cloud systems and know how they work. 
Then, without even knowing what is EC2, I signed up for the AWS architect associated level exam. 
Three month later, December 12th, I passed the exam. 

Here are some tips and thoughts I think worth sharing. 

- Why taking the exam: 

For me, taking this exam is a good entry way to cloud architect and building cloud software. 
The number of services on AWS is overwhelming. 
The exam only picks up the commonly used services in cloud software. 
They are the foundation of other more complicated services. 
The exam is not the best way to be an expert for any specific field, 
but it allows you to know the building blocks of cloud systems. 

- Exam preparation: 

Before I talk about how I study, I need to clarify my background: 
My day job is a software engineer, but my work doesn't include using AWS or other cloud platforms. 
I went to school for a CS degree. So before this, I have already known most concepts in computer science like networks, system architecture, database, etc.
This process is from a more professional perspective. 

My main study resources are 
1) [AWS practice question set](https://www.amazon.com/Certified-Solutions-Architect-Associate-SAA-C02/dp/B086B78M9G/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=22TWO6ZV3D88D&dchild=1&keywords=aws+certified+solutions+architect+associate&qid=1610331797&sprefix=aws+%2Caps%2C291&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzVExYWUNFNjU3SkNIJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMTI1ODYyRTZNMTk1QkRLQkVCJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA5MjcyODUxUjBUQlBRMTRXUTM5JndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==) 
2) AWS official documents 
3) AWS console
 

I use the question set as a roadmap for my study.
In each chapter, the book lists all the related services. 
I first read the document of these services, then go back to the question set to test my knowledge.
I take notes of what I didn't understand, then go back to AWS documents.
After that, I try to use the functions of the services, like creating an EC2 instance and log in through my AWS cli, etc. 
I use this study loop on every topic. Rinse, repeat, until I have a good understanding of them.

# Thoughts 

After I finished the exam, I always want to write something about it. 
It might be the most important experience for me during 2020. 
2020 was a strange year, if not the strangest, to me, to the world. 
At some point, I doubted every decision of mine and questioned my capability of accomplishing anything. 
The exam gave me an excuse to mute all the useless noise in my head and forced me to focus. 

Another life lesson: when in doubt, take action. 

I learned to allow myself to be sad or have a mental breakdown.
But at the end of the day, I take actions to solve my problems.
The process of solving a problem will generate new ideas. 
New ideas will motivate more actions. 
Keep the momentum, improvement will follow. 

As usual, keep calm and coding on.
