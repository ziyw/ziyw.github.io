title: 'Is it worth it?' 
---

Early March this year I decided to leave my previous job. At the very last day, I went back to the office to drop off work stuff. On my way there I saw a bunch of nice houses in Chevy Chase Section 5 that I never noticed before. It was windy and freezing cold. My coworker and I had some snacks sitting at the cafe next to the office. We were talking about how the year was going, how Covid changed our lives, how therapy was going. Then I asked "Sometimes I just wonder what's the point of all these? Is it all worth it?"

Short life update is during the past 6 months I moved from the US to Canada and started a new job. (May or may not talk about in the future)

There are few magical moments recently. One is I got my eyes checked for the first time in 5 years and got the right prescription. I have never seen the world so clear my adult life! Another is I finally bought a helmet. Bike by the ocean on a sunny Saturday morning is just pure magical.

To my question, for anyone who is wondering the same thing and need this confirmation, yes, it's all worth it. 

I spent a huge amount of time trying to convince myself through reading and journaling. They are helpful to some extend but not as effective as taking actions. Doing things is more important than just thinking. A better answer is, "it is worth it or not" actually doesn't matter. You don't need answer anybody but yourself. Life is simpler and easier when I start to put this question down and start to live a life. It's a hell amount of work to improve your life even just a little bit. Then there will be those magical moments that nobody can take away. 

Yes, it's so fucking worth it.
