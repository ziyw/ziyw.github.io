title: 'This Year in Reading, Living and Coding' 
---

The past year was the year that adulthood hit me the hardest. (hence the radio silence) I was really frustrated for a while. Then a series of trivial events mysteriously lead me out of that frustration.

First, getting into reading fiction. For a long time, I kinda ignored the genre and spent all the reading time on non-fiction and technical reading. Then I started the year by reading *Station Eleven*. I was shocked by how good it is and how strong I resonate with “Because survival is insufficient.” Then I picked up *the Dutch House* by Ann Patchett. It almost feels like somebody is secretly peeking into my brain this whole year. Then showed me how ridiculous I was from a perspective I never thought. Feels like a slap across my face and puts an end to my seems-never-ending reminiscing. Then I started to read Dune. To be honest, I didn’t believe in fate. But dune IS my fate. My life will never be the same after this rendezvous.

Second, Elden ring. As a casual gamer, I have spent 80 hours on it and still on going. My average playtime for a game is about 25 hours.

Third, a decade. I have been an adult for 10 years now. That means I have finally reached the age that “a lot of friends are getting married and having babies”. Meanwhile, the most exciting things for me are still coding, reading, and video games. Also, I have been programming for 10 years since college now. To be honest, I was disappointed in myself for the longest time last year. I have never felt so behind and lacked growth. I believe at some point I have hit rock bottom, that’s when things start to change.

Back in the first year of college, I read Steven Levy’s Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution. That was way before I got in the industry and called myself a programmer. I was amazed by the programmers in the book of their curiosity, passion, and ambition. And after that book, I never view programming as a job. It’s not a job. It’s my favorite thing in the world. So of course it means a lot to me and I take it personally.

There is no other way of getting better other than work harder. More study, more reading, more writing, more finding my people sharing the same feeling.

Here’s to another 10 years.
