title: 'This Year in Coding: Back.' 
---

Wow. It has been so long. So many emotions from the past year. Let's not talk about them. 
No matter I write about them or not, those experiences are already part of me now. 

I don't believe growth can be unintentional. Because only decay is unintentional. 
Growth is painful in every fucking way. 
It gets messy and frustrating sometimes, but that's just us trying to figure out. 
I'm not sure how much I have grown, but I know I have tried a few times to figure things out. 

Back to this. 
This is a supposed to be an reserved corner for me to shut the noise out and hear myself thinking. 
But throughout time, it has been a place I treat so seriously that I overthink everything I want to write meanwhile trying to write more. 
The two forces cancel each other out and only leave me nothing.

Try again, fail again, fail better, I guess. 

Another year: make mistakes, write stupid things, read whatever, learn everything.
