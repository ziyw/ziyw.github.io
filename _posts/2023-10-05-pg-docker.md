title: 'Preload Postgres Docker' 
---

Playing with docker for a bit, the only lesson for myself is **read the fucking document**. 

This simple example here is to start a Postgres container with pre-loaded data.
This is done by putting sql file in `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/` directory. Why? What is this directory? check `Initialization scripts` in <https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres>. Basically if you put sql data here, when postgres has no data, it will load everything in the dir. 

Dockerfile: 
```Dockerfile
FROM postgres:16.0
COPY logdb.sql /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/

# bonus: install vim 
RUN ["apt-get", "update"]
RUN ["apt-get", "install", "-y", "vim"]
```

In this case, we also want to create a volume to persist all data, so next time starting the container, all data will still exist. Actually if you don't create the volume, Postgres will create one itself. So skip if you want, really just a better naming.

To run: 
```shell
docker image build . -t my-pg-img # create image 
docker volume create pgdata # create volume 

# create the container from the image and run 
docker run -d \
--name my-pg \
-p 5432:5432 \
-e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres \
-e POSTGRES_USER=postgres \
-v pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
my-pg-img
```

To check result: 
```shell
docker exec -it my-pg bash # open bash
psql -U postgres # open psql 
# in psql
SELECT * from dslog; # check the result of the pre-load db, change it to your own table name 
```

Stumbled on `/usr/local/bin/docker-entrypoint.sh` file when I was researching this. There are more hard ways to pre-load data, but postgres really made it easy. 

### Bonus: create database dump 

```shell
# testdb is an existing postgres database 
pg_dump testdb > some/path/testdb.sql  # create database dump
psql testdb < some/path/testdb.sql     # load dump to database
```
