## Introduction ##
Hi there, this is Ziyan. I spend most of my non-sleeping time coding, reading, contributing in various ways to my existential crisis and actively taking actions to resolve my existential crisis. In general, still optimistic. 

"Another journal" is an attempt to collect my random thoughts. Some will be programming related. I also like writing things outside of computer programs. So this place will never be a pure tech blog.

Also, a little reminder: **life is worth living** and **you will figure it out**.
