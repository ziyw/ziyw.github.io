Hey there, this is Ziyan.

This is a personal blog. It will work as another journal of mine, where I can jot down some random thoughts, put together more organized notes or just share some personal feelings. Since programming is my day job, there will be a lot programming related topics here. 

If you find anything interesting here, I would be more than happy to talk about it, find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/_noizy_w).
