Hey there, this is Ziyan. I'm a programmer. 

Here is a personal blog. It will work as another journal of mine, where I can jot down some random thoughts, put together more organized notes or just share some personal feelings. Since programming is my daily job, there will be a lot programming related topics here. 

Everything here is written by me. It is inevitable for me to make mistakes. If you find any wrong fact, I would really appreciate it if you can let me know. 

If you find anything interesting here, I would be more than happy to talk about it, find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/_noizy_w).
